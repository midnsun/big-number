# big-number
Big int, big unsigned int and big rational types library

Big rational can be used as usual floating-point types. Iostream cout works as "numerator/denomirator" in 10th base. Also can be converted to string using string::to_string(). Floating and raw (in hex) outputs avaliable.

Default cout<< output for Biguint and Bigint works in hex, but big raional type can be used as integer types.
